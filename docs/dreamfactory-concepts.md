DreamFactory is an open-source REST API platform that allows developers to quickly build and deploy secure and scalable applications. It provides a powerful set of tools and features to simplify the process of creating APIs for various data sources and services.

## Key Concepts

### API Generation
DreamFactory can automatically generate APIs for various data sources, including databases, file systems, and external services. This feature significantly reduces development time and ensures consistency across different API endpoints.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Security is a core feature of DreamFactory. The platform offers robust RBAC, allowing administrators to define granular permissions for different user roles, ensuring that data access is properly controlled and secured.

### API Keys
DreamFactory uses API keys for authentication and authorization. These keys can be easily managed, rotated, and revoked, providing a flexible and secure way to control access to your APIs.

### Scripting
DreamFactory supports server-side scripting using languages like PHP, Python, and Node.js. This allows developers to add custom logic and business rules to their APIs without modifying the underlying data sources.

### Swagger Documentation
Every API created with DreamFactory comes with automatically generated Swagger documentation. This makes it easy for developers to understand and interact with the API endpoints.

### Event System
DreamFactory includes a powerful event system that allows you to trigger custom scripts or external services based on API calls. This enables complex workflows and integrations.

### Caching
To improve performance, DreamFactory includes built-in caching mechanisms. This helps reduce load on backend systems and improves response times for frequently accessed data.

### Versioning
API versioning is supported out of the box, allowing developers to maintain multiple versions of their APIs simultaneously. This ensures backward compatibility while enabling ongoing development.

### Limits and Throttling
DreamFactory provides tools for setting rate limits and throttling API requests. This helps protect your services from abuse and ensures fair usage across all consumers.

### System APIs
In addition to user-created APIs, DreamFactory includes a set of system APIs for managing users, roles, services, and other platform features. These APIs can be used to automate administrative tasks and integrate DreamFactory with other systems.

By understanding these core concepts, developers and administrators can leverage the full power of DreamFactory to create robust, secure, and scalable API solutions.
